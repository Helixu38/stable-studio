Freelancers can also work on other projects if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey wish since they are not buonded by contracts. Cons are that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollaborations between freelancers will take extra coordination.",

	"aqua_weak_racoon_propel": "Since we are operating globally and we want to simplify the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpricing, we set the same price for all regions which is why it seems\n\t\t\t\t\t\tridiculously cheap when you are from United States or European\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries. Also, we do not handle company branding nor designing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom scratch since we want to control costs. We believe using\n\t\t\t\t\t\texisting designs for reference works 99% of the time and there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost always a design that fits your business needs. Lastly, we are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta growing studio and our aim is to build connections. We don't\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpect to make lots of profit in early stages and we want to provide\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquality services at an affordable price.",

Lastly, we offer free consultations for small and\t\t\t\t\t\tmedium sized businesses to help you avoid spending unnecessary money\t\t\t\t\t\tand choosing the right tech stack. Don't fret even if you know\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing about tech. We all start from zero at some point.",

	"true_stale_macaw_pride": "The crucial details are outlined in the process section. You need\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto think about what features your websites need: maybe a gallery for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tphotos, maybe a section for testimonials or somehthing unique like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinteractive playground. We give advices but the ultimate decision\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlies in your hand. For SEO, relying on on-page optimization alone\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas limited effects on how well your ranking can improve in search\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresults. Our suggestion is to let us know which feature you think is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquite unique in the market and would like us to stress about, then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombine both on & off-page optimizations to get the optimal results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor one-off plans, you need to pay 50% up-front and then the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremanining 50% after project is finished. We use stripe for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpayments.",
	"lost_north_earthworm_tap": "Can the website be updated after the project is finished?",
	"brief_fun_herring_pull": "For one-off plans, you get one revision after the website is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeployed. Any further revisions require extra fees. In most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscenarios it would be a minimal fee of $20 but updates with layout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges or new animations will cost more. For monthly subscriptions,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou enjoy the privilege of having unlimited revisions. However, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttech stack the website is build with cannot be changed since it will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe too costly.",
